    <p class="event">Giving hongbao during Chinese New Year</p>
    <p class="text">
      The Chinese New Year, or Spring Festival, is the happiest time of the year
      for nearly all children in China. <br />
      No matter what region or background their families are from, they normally
      receive hongbao (lucky money). <br />
      Hongbao usually consists of brand new bills put in a red envelop and given
      by the elders of the family. <br />
      The hongbao represents blessings for the year to come. <br />
      People tend to stop receiving hongbao when they begin to work, but in some
      parts of China <br />
      (for example Guangdong and Hong Kong), people can receive hongbao until
      they get married.

    <p class="event">Eating dumplings during the Winter Solstice</p>
    <p class="text">
      People who are new to China might feel confused on the Winter Solstice.
      <br />
      Nearly all the big and small dumpling (jiaozi) restaurants are severely
      overflowing with customers. <br />
      Even the Chinese friends who choose not to dine out will most likely order
      a dumpling delivery. <br />
      That’s because, rumor has it, if you’re not eating dumplings on the Winter
      Solstice, <br />
      your ears will be bitten off by the freezing cold wind.

    <p class="event">Downing your drink after saying “ganbei”</p>
    <p class="text">
      What follows “Ganbei” (Cheers) and glass clinking in China is people
      drinking up the alcohol in their glasses,<br />
      instead of just taking a gentle sip. If you don’t drink up your wine, you
      might be regarded as impolite in China. <br />
      However, those who can’t drink alcohol don’t need to worry, as there’s a
      Chinese custom that says, <br />
      “Replace the wine with tea (Yi Cha Dai Jiu).” This makes it convenient for
      everyone to drink up after saying cheers.
